I modified the original code for this website to include more semantic HTML elements to make it more accessible for screen readers. I also simplified the CSS so that there were fewer classes, and made it less redundant. I also fixed one of the HTML links so that it moves to the correct spot on the page. The images didn't have any alts so I added those as well. The order of the elements in the HTML and CSS was also modified so that they mirrored the flow of the actual webpage when it is deployed.
